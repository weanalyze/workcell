# Quick Start

Let's discover **Workcell in less than 3 minutes**.

## Getting Started

Get started by **creating a new workcell**.

Or **try workcell immediately** on **[weanalyze.co](https://weanalyze.co)**.

## ⚡ Run workcell in 1-click

Generate a new workcell app using the **workcell-cli**.

A starter workcell project will automatically be inited and running after you run the command:

```bash
# install 
pip install workcell
# run
workcell hello
```

You can type this command into Command Prompt, Powershell, Terminal, or any other integrated terminal of your code editor.

You will see output in terminal like:

```shell
➜ workcell hello
Workcell project_dir created: /home/ubuntu/hello_workcell
INFO:     Started server process [30567]
INFO:     Waiting for application startup.
INFO:     Application startup complete.
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:7860 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```

Open `http://127.0.0.1:7860` by browser you will see a [Swagger UI](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui) for your workcell services. 

Just goto `http://127.0.0.1:7860/ui` and enjoy your workcell app:)
